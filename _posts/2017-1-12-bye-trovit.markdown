## It has been a pleasure to be part of the Trovit team

After almost 2 years at Trovit the day to change has arrived and i'm going to start a new challenge. Today I’m sure that two years ago I made the best decision I could take by joining Trovit. I have been working with great professionals and I have been able to learn from them. 
From here I take many great moments, a lot of learning and many friends. I am sure that in the future we will meet again.

Today I remember hundreds of moments. I’m remembering my first deploy just my second day at Trovit. My first AfterTrovit, the travel to Japan or the number of times that i had to go to Systems guys to talk about the beanstalks status.

Only I can say that I wish you all the best! 

#### If Trovit it’s cool, why this change?
Sometimes there are opportunities that only pass once and this one I couldn’t let pass. This challenge brings me four important things that made me decide to accept it.

- GoLang
<br/>
- Project from scratch (or almost)
<br/>
- High volume of data
<br/>
- The team that I’m joining
